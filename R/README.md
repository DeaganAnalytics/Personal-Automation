# About
This folder contains R scripts and functions I've developed to automate reports and processes, primarily for workplace tasks. The contents are organised into the following subfolders:

| Folder     | Description                                                                 |
|------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `Functions` | Reusable R functions for tasks like reading files, formatting output, and handling dates. |
| `Scripts`   | Standalone R scripts that demonstrate setup or logic used in reporting workflowsâ€”function-like, but not formal functions. |
| `SQL`       | Example SQL files used by the `read_sql.R` function.                     |
| `Text`      | Example text files used by the `read_text.R` function. |

Many of these functions were created to support repeatable workflows or automate steps in reporting pipelines. See individual file comments and examples for usage details.
