# About This Repo
This repository contains a collection of scripts I've developed to automate tasks and analyse data, using a mix of R, Python, batch files, and SQL.

The repo is organised into the following folders:
- **R** – Reporting and data automation using R functions and scripts
- **Python** – Small tools for automating administrative tasks
- **Batch Scripts** – Toy examples created while experimenting with `.bat` files
- **SQL** – Reusable SQL queries and templates

## R
This folder contains a collection of R functions and scripts built over time to support reporting and process automation. The table inside `R/README.md` provides more detail on the major functions.

Other scripts and helper functions are relatively simple and self-explanatory.

## Python
A small set of Python scripts used to automate administrative or repetitive tasks, typically for personal use or internal workflow improvements.

## Batch Scripts
These are lightweight `.bat` files created while experimenting with Windows batch scripting. They’re mostly trivial and not used regularly, but kept here for reference.
