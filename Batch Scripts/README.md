# About
A collection of batch scripts I was experimenting with. Basically some toy examples that would only work is the specified programs were installed.

I started exploring batch files during one job where I had automated saving files into a document management system (M-Files), complete with metadata — some of which was dynamically generated, like dates — using R or Python depending on the use case. When I expanded this workflow to the accounting team, they weren’t allowed to use R or Python, so I looked into batch files as a workaround to run compiled `.exe` versions of the scripts and let them input parameters.

The examples here are:

| Script Name         | Description                                         | What It Does                                                                 |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| open_programs.bat   | Open a few programs while closing others            | Opens Outlook, Teams, and Edge; closes Lifesize                              |
| close_programs.bat  | Close common applications I have open               | Closes Outlook, Teams, Excel, Word, RStudio, PyCharm, Edge, etc.             |

Nothing here is particularly clever or production-ready—just saved for reference from when I was messing around with batch automation.
